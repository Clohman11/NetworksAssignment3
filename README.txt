-Client and server ran on VMS in google cloud using python3 and 
command line options as given on assignment.
We did not use command line arguments for port and IP on the server or client.
Run by changing HOST,IP in client/server.

Lines 55,81 show the log message made for the server when retransmissions
are made. The same ACK and sequence as before are used for these messages.
The increment for the file in memory is not changed on a retransmission.
